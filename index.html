        <h1>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</h1>
        <p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
        <p> Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a lawyer,
            politician and
            the founder of Pakistan.[2] Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until
            Pakistan's
            independence on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is revered
            in Pakistan as Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum, "Father of the Nation"). His birthday is
            considered
            a national holiday in Pakistan .[3][4]</p>
        <p>Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his
            return to
            British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which
            eventually
            replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two
            decades
            of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity,
            helping
            to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had
            also
            become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League, and proposed a
            fourteen-point
            constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned
            from
            the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.

        </p>
        <p>
            By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state. In
            that year, the
            Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation. During the Second
            World
            War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held
            shortly
            after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League
            could not reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all
            parties
            to agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and
            policies, and to aid
            the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after
            independence,
            personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just
            over
            a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in
            Pakistan.
            Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several universities and
            public
            buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, he remains
            Pakistan's
            greatest leader.
